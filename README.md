# Micro model inference

## Overview

This project involves interfacing the built-in camera of the Raspberry Pi 5 using FFmpeg, processing image data with OpenCV, and preparing datasets for object detection using YOLOv5. The project includes data annotations, image augmentations, and outlines future work for optimization.

## Achievements

1. **Camera Interface with FFmpeg**  
   Successfully interfaced the built-in camera of the Raspberry Pi 5 with FFmpeg. The camera stream was captured and processed to convert frames into a format compatible with OpenCV for further analysis and manipulation.

2. **Data Annotations and Conversion**  
   Developed a system for annotating data and converting the annotations from XML format into a YOLOv5-compatible format. This step is crucial for training the YOLOv5 model for object detection tasks.

3. **Image Augmentations**  
   Implemented various image augmentation techniques to enhance the training dataset. This process helps improve the model's robustness and generalization by artificially increasing the diversity of the training data.

## Future Work

- **Fixed and Floating Point Arithmetic**  
  Investigating the implementation of fixed and floating point arithmetic to optimize computational efficiency and precision in processing tasks.

- **Data Compression**  
  Exploring techniques for data compression to reduce storage requirements and improve the speed of data transfer and processing.

- **Assembly and C Programming**  
  Plans to optimize the existing Python scripts by converting them into Assembly and C programming to minimize overhead and enhance performance.

## Conclusion

The project successfully establishes a framework for image processing and object detection using the Raspberry Pi 5 and FFmpeg. Future enhancements will focus on optimizing performance and increasing the efficiency of the pipeline through advanced programming techniques.
